The Caesar Cipher is a simple and well-known encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate securely with his officials. 
The method involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

How It Works :

  Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
  
  Decryption: The process of reverting the shifted characters back to their original positions using the same shift value.
